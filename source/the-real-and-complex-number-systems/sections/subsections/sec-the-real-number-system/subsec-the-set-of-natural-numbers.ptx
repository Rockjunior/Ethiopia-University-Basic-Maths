        <p>
            The history of numbers indicated that the first set of numbers used by the ancient human beings 
            for counting purpose was the set of natural (counting) numbers.

                    If two natural numbers <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m> are added using the operation

                    by <m>c</m>, then we can write the operation as:  <m>c=a+b</m>,

                <p>
                    i. For any two natural numbers <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m>, the sum <m>a+b</m> is also a natural number. 
                    For instance in the above example, <m>3</m> and <m>8</m> are natural numbers, their sum <m>11</m> is also a natural number.
                    In general, we say that the set of natural numbers is closed under addition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ii. For any two natural numbers <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m>, <m>a+b=b+a</m>.
                </p>
                <example>
                    <statement>
                        <p>
                            <m>3+8 = 8+3 = 11</m>. In general, we say that addition is commutative on the set of natural numbers.
                        </p>
                    </statement>
                </example>
                <p>
                    iii. For any three natural numbers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> &amp; <m>c</m>, <m>(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)</m>.
                </p>
                <example>
                    <statement>
                        <p>
                            <m>(3+8)+6 = 3+(8+6) = 17</m>. In general, we say that addition is associative on the set of natural numbers.
                        </p>
                    </statement>
                </example>
                <p>
                    iv. For any two natural numbers <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m>, the product <m>a \times b</m> is also a natural number. 
                    For instance in the above example, <m>3</m> and <m>4</m> are natural numbers, their product <m>12</m> is also a natural number. 
                    In general, we say that the set of natural numbers is closed under multiplication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    v. For any two natural numbers <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m>, <m>a \times b = b \times a</m>.
                </p>
                <example>
                    <statement>
                        <p>
                            <m>3 \times 4 = 4 \times 3 = 12. </m> In general, we say that multiplication is commutative on the set of natural numbers.
                        </p>
                    </statement>
                </example>
                <p>
                    vi. For any three natural numbers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> &amp; <m>c</m>, <m>(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)</m>.
                </p>
                <example>
                    <statement>
                        <p>
                            <m>(2 \times 4)\times 5 = 2 \times (4 \times 5) = 40</m>.
                            In general, we say that multiplication is associative on the set of natural numbers.
                        </p>
                    </statement>
                </example>
                <p>
                    vii. For any natural number <m>a</m>, it holds that <m>a \times 1 = 1 \times a = a</m>.
                </p>
                <example>
                    <statement>
                        <p>
                            <m>6 \times 1 = 1 \times 6 = 6.</m> In general, we say that multiplication 
                            has an identity element on the set of natural numbers and <m>1</m> is the identity element.
                        </p>
                    </statement>
                </example>
                <p>
                    For any three natural numbers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> &amp; <m>c</m>, <m>a \times (b+c) = (a \times b)+(a \times c)</m>.
                </p>
                <example>
                    <statement>
                        <p>
                            <m>3\times (5+7) = (3 \times 5)+ (3 \times 7) = 36</m>. 
                            In general, we say that multiplication is distributive over addition on the set of natural numbers.

                <p>
                    Consider two numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, we say <m>a</m> is greater than <m>b</m> 
                    denoted by <m>a</m> &gt; <m>b</m> if <m>a - b</m> is positive.
