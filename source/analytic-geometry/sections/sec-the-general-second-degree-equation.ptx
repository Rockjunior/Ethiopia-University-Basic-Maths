            <li>
                <p>be able to convert a given general second degree equation to an equivalent simpler standard form of equation of a conic section.</p>

    <p>In the previous sections we have seen that, except in degenerate cases, the graph of the equation</p>
    <p><m>Ax_2 + Cy_2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0</m></p>
    <p>is a circle, parabola, ellipse or hyperbola. The construction of these equations was based on the assumption that the axis of symmetry of a conic section is parallel to one of the coordinate axes. The assumption seems to be quite restrictive because the axis of symmetry for a parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola can be any oblique line as indicated in their corresponding definitions.</p>
    <p>However, the reason why we have assumed that is not only for simplicity but there is always a coordinate system whose one of the axes is parallel to a desired line of symmetry. In particular, we can rotate the axes of our <em>xy</em><alert>-</alert>coordinate system, whenever needed, so as to form a new <em>x</em>'<em>y</em>'-coordinate system such that either the x'- axis or y'-axis is parallel to the desired line of symmetry. Toward this end, let us review the notion of rotation of axes.</p>
