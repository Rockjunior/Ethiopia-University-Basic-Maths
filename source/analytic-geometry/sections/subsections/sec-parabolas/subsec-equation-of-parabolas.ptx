            <term>I: Equation of a parabola whose axis is parallel to the <m>y</m>-axis</term>:
        </p>
        <p>
            A parabola whose axis is parallel to <m>y</m>-axis is called <m>\textbf{vertical parabola}</m>. A vertical parabola is either open upward (as in Figure 4.13 (a) ) or open downward (as in Figure 4.13 (b)).

            Let <m>p</m> be the distance from vertex <m>\text{V}(h,k)</m> to the focus <m>\text{F}</m> of the parabola, i.e.,<m>|VF| = p</m>. Then, by the definition,<m> \text{F}</m> is located <m>p</m> units above <m>\text{V} </m>if the parabola opens upward and it is located <m>p</m> units below <m>\text{V}</m> if the parabola opens downward as indicated on Figure 4.13(a) and (b), respectively. To determine the desired equation, we first consider the case when the parabola opens upward.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, considering a vertical parabola with vertex <m> \text{v(h,k)}</m> that opens upward (Figure 4.13a), its focus is at <m>\text{F(h, k+p})</m>. <m>\Rightarrow</m> The equation of its directrix is <m>\text{y = k−p.}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, for any point <m>\text{P(x,y)} </m> on the parabola, <m>|PF|</m> is equal to the distance between P and the directrix if and only if 
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>\sqrt{(x-h)^2\, +\, (y-k-p)^2 } = y \,-\,k\,+\,p</m>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Upon simplification, this becomes 
        </p>
        <sidebyside>

            <p>
                <m>(x -h)^2 = 4p(y - k)</m>
            </p>

        <p>
            In particular, if the vertex of a vertical parabola is at origin, i.e., <m>(h, k) =(0,0)</m> and opens upward, then its equation is

               <p>
                ( In this case, its focus is at <m>\text{F(0, p)}</m>, and its directrix is<m> y = -p </m>.)

        <p>
            If a vertical parabola with vertex <m>\text{V}(h, k)</m> opens downward, then its directrix is above the parabola and its focus lies below the vertex (see Figure 4.13(b). In this case,
            the focus is at <m>\text{F}(h, k−p)</m>, and its directrix is given by <m>y=k+p</m>. Moreover, following the same steps as above , the equation of this parabola becomes

                Since the parabola opens upward, its focus is <m>p</m> units above its vertex ⇒ its focus is at <m>\text{F}(0,\frac{1}{4})</m>; and its directrix is horizontal line <m>p</m> units below its vertex <m>\Rightarrow</m> its directrix is <m>y</m> = <m>\frac{-1}{4}</m>. You may sketch this parabola.

            A parabola whose axis is parallel to <m>\textbf{x}</m>-axis is called <m>\textbf{horizontal parabola}</m>. Such parabola opens either to the right or to the left as shown in Figure 4.15 (a) and (b), respectively.

            The equations of such sec-parabolas can be obtained by interchanging the role of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in the equations of the sec-parabolas discussed previously. These equations are stated below. In both cases, let the vertex of the parabola be at <m>\text{V}(h,k)</m>.
