<cell><alert>Definition</alert> 4.2. A circle is the locus of points (set of points) in a plane each of which is equidistant from a fixed point in the plane. The fixed point is called the <alert>center</alert> of the circle and the constant distance is called its <alert>radius</alert>.</cell>

<p>Definition 4.2 is illustrated by Figure 4.6 in which the center of the circle is denoted by ''C'' and its radius is denoted by <em>r</em>.</p>
<p>Observe that a circle is symmetric with respect its center. Based on the definition, a point P is on the circle if and only if its distance to C is <em>r</em>, that is <alert>|</alert>CP<alert>|</alert> = <em>r</em>. A point in the plane is said to be inside the circle if its distance to the center C is less than <em>r</em>. Similarly, a point in the plane is said to be outside the circle if its distance to C is greater than <em>r</em>. Moreover, a chord of the circle is a line segment whose endpoints are on the circle. A diameter is a chord of the circle through the center C. Consequently, C is the midpoint of a diameter and the length of a diameter is 2<em>r</em>. For example, AB and QR are diameters of the circle in Figure 4.6.</p>
<p><alert>Example 4.7</alert>: Consider a circle of radius 5 whose center is at C(2,1). Determine whether each of the following points is on the circle, inside the circle or outside the circle:</p>
<p>P<sub>1</sub>(5, 5), P<sub>2</sub>(4, 5), P<sub>3</sub>(−2, 5), P<sub>4</sub>(−1, −2), P<sub>5</sub>(2,−4), P<sub>6</sub>(7, 0).</p>
<p><alert>Solution</alert>: The distance between a given point P(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) and the center C(2,1) is given by</p>
<p><alert>|</alert>PC<alert>| =</alert> or <alert>.</alert> We need to compare <alert>|</alert>PC<alert>|</alert> with the radius 5. Note that <alert>|</alert>PC| =5 ⇔ |PC|<sup>2</sup>= 25, |PC|&lt; 5 ⇔ |PC|<sup>2</sup>&lt; 25 ,</p>
<p>and |PC| &gt;5 ⇔ |PC|<sup>2</sup> &gt; 25.</p>
<p>Thus, P is on the circle if |PC|<sup>2</sup> =25, inside the circle if <alert>|</alert>PC<alert>|</alert><sup>2</sup> &lt; 25 and outside the circle if <alert>|</alert>PC<alert>|</alert><sup>2</sup> &gt; 25. So, we can use the square distance to answer the question. Thus, as</p>
<p><alert>|</alert>P<sub>1</sub>C<alert>|</alert><sup>2</sup> = (5−2)<sup>2</sup>+(5−1)<sup>2</sup> = 25, <alert>|</alert>P<sub>2</sub>C<alert>|</alert><sup>2</sup> = (4−2)<sup>2</sup>+(5−1)<sup>2</sup> = 20 and <alert>|</alert>P<sub>3</sub>C<alert>|</alert><sup>2</sup> = (<alert>−</alert>2−2)<sup>2</sup>+(5−1)<sup>2</sup> = 32,</p>
<p>P<sub>1</sub> is on the circle, P<sub>2</sub> is inside the circle, and P<sub>3</sub> is outside the circle. Similarly, you can show that P<sub>4</sub> is inside the circle, P<sub>5</sub> is on the circle, and P<sub>6</sub> is outside the circle.</p>
