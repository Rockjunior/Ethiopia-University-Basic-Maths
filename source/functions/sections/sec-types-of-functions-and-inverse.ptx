                    A function <m>f:A \rightarrow B</m> is called <term>one to one</term>, often written 1 - 1, 
                    if and only if for all <m>x_{1},x_{2} \in A</m>, <m>f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2})</m> implies <m>x_{1} = x_{2}</m>. 
                    In words, no two elements of <m>A</m> are mapped to one element of <m>B</m>.

                            <p>
                                Consider the relation <m>f</m> from <m>Z</m> into <m>Z</m> defined by 
                                <m>f(n) = n^{2}</m> for all <m>n \in Z</m>. Now, domain of <m>f</m> is <m>Z</m>. 
                                Also, if <m>n = n^{&#39;}</m>, then <m>n^{2} = (n^{&#39;})^{2}</m>, i.e. 
                                <m>f(n) = f(n^{&#39;})</m>. Hence, <m>f</m> is well defined and is a function. 
                                However, <m>f(1) = 1 = f( - 1)</m> and <m>1 \neq - 1</m>, which implies that 
                                <m>f</m> is not 1 – 1. For all <m>n \in Z</m>, <m>f(n)</m> is a non-negative integer. 
                                This shows that a negative integer has no preimage. Hence, <m>f</m> is not onto. 
                                Note that <m>f</m> is onto <m>\left\{ 0,1,4,9,\cdots \right\}</m>.

                                <m>f(n) = 2n</m> for all <m>n \in Z</m>. As in the previous example, 
                                we can show that <m>f</m> is a function. Let <m>n,n^{&#39;} \in Z</m> and suppose 
                                that <m>f(n) = f(n^{&#39;})</m>. Then <m>2n = 2n^{&#39;}</m> and thus 
                                <m>n = n^{&#39;}</m>. Hence, <m>f</m> is 1 – 1. Since for all <m>n \in Z</m>, 
                                <m>f(n)</m> is an even integer; we see that an odd integer has no preimage. 
                                Therefore, <m>f</m> is not onto.

                    Since <m>f</m> is onto we have <m>\text{Range}(f) = A</m>.Thus, <m>A = \left\{ f(a_{1}),f(a_{2}),\cdots,f(a_{n}) \right\}</m>, 
                    which implies that <m>f(a_{1})</m>, <m>f(a_{2})</m>, <m>\cdots</m>, <m>f(a_{n})</m> are all distinct.

            <term>Inverse of a function</term>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Since a function is a relation , the inverse of a function <m>f</m> is denoted by <m>f^{- 1}</m> 
            and is defined by:
        </p>

        <p>
            <m>f^{- 1} = \left\{ (y,x):(x,y) \in f \right\}</m>
        </p>

        <p>
            For instance, if <m>f = \left\{ (2,4),(3,6),(1,7) \right\}</m>, then 
            <m>f^{- 1} = \left\{ (4,2),(6,3),(7,1) \right\}</m>. Note that the inverse of a function is not always 
            a function. To see this consider the function <m>f =</m><m>(5,4)</m>. 
            Then, <m>f^{- 1} = \left\{ (4,2),(6,3),(4,5) \right\}</m>, which is not a function.
        </p>

        <p>
            As we have seen above not all functions have an inverse, so it is important to determine whether or 
            not a function has an inverse before we try to find the inverse. If the function does not have an inverse, 
            then we need to realize that it does not have an inverse so that we do not waste our time trying to 
            find something that does not exist.
        </p>

        <p>
            A one to one function is special because only one to one functions have inverse. 
            If a function is one to one, to find the inverse we will follow the steps below:
            <ol marker="1">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Interchange <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in the equation <m>y = f(x)</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Solving the resulting equation for <m>y</m>, we will obtaining the inverse function.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that the domain of the inverse function is the range of the original function and the range of 
            the inverse function is the domain of the original function.
        </p>

                Even though, in general, we use an exponent of <m>- 1</m> to indicate a reciprocal, 
                inverse function notation is an exception to this rule. Please be aware that <m>f^{- 1}(x)</m> is not the reciprocal of 
                <m>f</m>. That is,
                <me>
                    f^{- 1}(x) \neq \frac{1}{f(x)}
                </me>
                If we want to write the reciprocal of the function <m>f(x)</m> by using a negative exponent, we must write
                <me>
                    \frac{1}{f(x)} = \left\lbrack f(x) \right\rbrack^{- 1}
                </me>
