<introduction>

<p>After completing this section, the student should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>define polynomial and rational functions</p></li>
<li><p>apply the theorems on polynomials to find the zeros of polynomial functions</p></li>
<li><p>use the division algorithm to find quotient and remainder</p></li>
<li><p>apply theorems on polynomials to solve related problems</p></li>
<li><p>sketch and analyze the graphs of rational functions</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The functions described in this section frequently occur as mathematical models of real-life situations. For instance, in business the demand function gives the price per item, <m>p</m>, in terms of the number of items sold, <m>x</m>. Suppose a company finds that the price <m>p</m>(in Birr) for its model GC-5 calculator is related to the number of calculators sold, <m>x</m>(in millions), and is given by the demand function <m>p = \text{80} - x^{2}\text{.}</m></p>
<p>The manufacturer’s revenue is determined by multiplying the number of items sold (<m>x</m>) by the price per item (<m>p</m>). Thus, the revenue function is</p>

<p>These demand and revenue functions are examples of polynomial functions. The major aim of this section is to better understand the significance of applied functions (such as this demand function). In order to do this, we need to analyze the domain, range, and behavior of such functions.</p>

<p>The zeros of a polynomial function provide valuable information that can be helpful in sketching its graph. One can find the zeros by factorizing the polynomial. However, we have no general method for factorizing polynomials of degree greater than 2. In this subsection, we turn our attention to methods that will allow us to find zeros of higher degree polynomials. To do this, we first need to discuss about the division algorithm. Recall that a number <m>a</m> is a zero of a polynomial function <m>p</m> if <m>p(a) = 0</m>.</p>

<p>With the aid of the division algorithm, we can derive two important theorems that will allow us to recognize the zeros of polynomials.</p>

<p>The Factor and Remainder theorems establish the intimate relationship between the factors of a polynomial <m>p(x)</m> and its zeros. Recall that a polynomial of degree <em>n</em> can have at most <em>n</em> zeros.</p>
<p>Does every polynomial have a zero? Our answer depends on the number system in which we are working. If we restrict ourselves to the set of real number system, then we are already familiar with the fact that the polynomial <m>p(x) = x^{2} + 1</m> has no real zeros. However, this polynomial does have two zeros in the complex number system. (The zeros are <m>i</m> and <m>- i</m>). Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), in his doctoral dissertation, proved that within the complex number system, every polynomial of degree <m>\ 1</m> has at least one zero. This fact is usually referred to as the Fundamental theorem of Algebra.</p>

<p>From the linear factorization theorem, it follows that every polynomial of degree <m>n \geq 1</m> has exactly <m>n</m> zeros in the complex number system, where a root of multiplicity <m>k</m> counted <m>k</m> times.</p>

<p>Thus, <m>f(x)\  = \frac{1}{4}(x + 1)^{3}\ (x - 2)^{4}(x - 5)^{2}</m>.</p>

<p>Our experience in using the quadratic formula on quadratic equations with real coefficients has shown us that complex roots always appear in conjugate pairs. For example, the roots of <m>x^{2} - 2x + 5 = 0</m> are <m>1 + 2i</m> and <m>1 - 2i</m>. In fact, this property extends to all polynomial equations with real coefficients.</p>

<p><alert>Solution</alert>: According to the Conjugate Roots Theorem, if <m>1 - \sqrt{3}\ i</m> is a zero, then its conjugate, <m>1 + \sqrt{3}\ i</m> must also be a zero. Therefore, <m>x - (1 - \sqrt{3}\ i\ )</m>and <m>x - (1 + \sqrt{3}\ i\ )</m> are both factors of <m>r(x)</m>, and so their product must be a factor of <m>r(x)</m>. That is, <m>\lbrack x - (1 - \sqrt{3}\ i\ )\rbrack</m><m>\lbrack x - (1 + \sqrt{3}\ i\ )\rbrack =</m><m>x^{2} - 2x + 4</m>is a factor of <m>r(x)</m>. Dividing <m>r(x)</m> by <m>x^{2} - 2x + 4</m>, we obtain</p>
<p>Thus, the zeros of <m>r(x)</m> are <m>1 - \sqrt{3}\ i</m>, <m>1 + \sqrt{3}\ i</m>, <m>- 5</m> and 1.</p>
<p>The theorems we have discussed so far are called existence theorems because they ensure the existence of zeros and linear factors of polynomials. These theorems do not tell us how to find the zeros or the linear factors. The Linear Factorization Theorem guarantees that we can factor a polynomial of degree at least one into linear factors, but it does not tell us how.</p>
<p>We know from experience that if <m>p(x)</m> happens to be a quadratic function, then we may find the zeros of <m>p(x) = \text{Ax}^{2} + \text{Bx} + C</m> by using the quadratic formula to obtain the zeros</p>

<p><m>x = \frac{- B \pm \sqrt{B^{2} - 4\text{AC}}}{2A}\text{.}</m></p>

<p>The rest of this subsection is devoted to developing some special methods for finding the zeros of a polynomial function.</p>
<p>As we have seen, even though we have no general techniques for factorizing polynomials of degree greater than 2, if we happen to know a root, say <m>r</m>, we can use long division to divide <m>p(x)</m> by <m>x - r</m> and obtain a quotient polynomial of lower degree. If we can get the quotient polynomial down to a quadratic, then we are able to determine all the roots. But how do we find a root to start the process? The following theorem can be most helpful.</p>

<p>To get a feeling as to why this theorem is true, suppose <m>\frac{3}{2}</m> is a root of <m>a_{3}x^{3} + a_{2}x^{2} + a_{1}x + a_{0} = 0</m>.</p>
<p>Then, <m>a_{3}\left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{3} + a_{2}\left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{2} + a_{1}\left( \frac{3}{2} \right) + a_{0} = 0</m> which implies that</p>
<p><m>\frac{\text{27}a_{3}}{8} + \frac{9a_{2}}{4} + \frac{3a_{1}}{2} + a_{0} = 0</m> multiplying both sides by 8</p>

<p>If we look at equation (1), the left hand side is divisible by 3, and therefore the right hand side must also be divisible by 3. Since 8 is not divisible by 3, <m>a_{0}</m> must be divisible by 3. From equation (2), <m>a_{3}</m> must be divisible by 2.</p>
<p><alert>Example 3.24</alert>: Find all the zeros of the function <m>p(x) = 2x^{3} + 3x^{2} - \text{23}x - \text{12}\text{.}</m></p>
<p><alert>Solution</alert>: According to the Rational Root Theorem, if <m>\frac{p}{q}</m> is a rational root of the given equation, then <m>p</m> must be a factor of <m>- \text{12}</m> and <m>q</m> must be a factor of 2. Thus, we have</p>
<p>possible values of <m>p</m>: <m>\pm 1,\  \pm 2,\  \pm 3,\  \pm 4,\  \pm 6,\  \pm \text{12}</m></p>
<p>possible values of <m>q</m>: <m>\pm 1,\  \pm 2</m></p>
<p>possible rational roots <m>\frac{p}{q}</m>: <m>\pm 1,\  \pm \ \frac{1}{2},\  \pm 2,\  \pm 3,\  \pm \ \frac{3}{2},\  \pm 4,\  \pm 6,\  \pm \text{12}</m></p>
<p>We may check these possible roots by substituting the value in <m>p(x)</m>. Now <m>p(1) = - \text{30}</m> and <m>p( - 1) = \text{12}</m>. Since <m>p(1)</m> is negative and <m>p( - 1)</m> is positive, by location theorem, <m>p(x)</m> has a zero between <m>- 1</m> and 1. Since <m>P\left( - \frac{1}{2} \right) = 0</m>, then <m>\left( x + \frac{1}{2} \right)</m> is a factor of <m>p(x)</m>. Using long division, we obtain</p>
<p><m>\begin{matrix}
p(x) = 2x^{3} + 3x^{2} - \text{23}x - \text{12} = (x + \frac{1}{2})(2x^{2} + 2x - \text{24}) \\
\  = 2(x + \frac{1}{2})(x + 4)(x - 3) \\

<p>A rational function is a function of the form where both <em>n</em>(<em>x</em>) and <em>d</em>(<em>x</em>) are polynomials and <m>d(x) \neq 0</m>.</p>
<p><alert>Example 3.25</alert>: The functions <m>f(x) = \frac{3}{x + 5}</m>, <m>f(x) = \frac{x - 1}{x^{2} - 4}</m> and <m>f(x) = \frac{x^{5} + 2x^{3} - x + 1}{x + 5x}</m> are examples of rational function.</p>
<p>Note that the domain of the rational function is <m>\left\{ x:d(x) \neq 0 \right\}</m></p>
<p><alert>Example 3.26</alert>: Find the domain and zeros of the function <m>f(x) = \frac{3x - 5}{x^{2} - x - \text{12}}</m>.</p>
<p><alert>Solution</alert>: The values of <m>x</m> for which <m>x^{2} - x - \text{12} = 0</m> are excluded from the domain of <m>f\text{.}</m>Since <m>x^{2} - x - \text{12} = (x - 4)(x + 3)</m>, we have <m>\text{Dom}(f) = \left\{ x:x \neq - 3,4 \right\}</m>. To find the zeros of <m>f(x)</m>, we solve the equation</p>
<p><m>\frac{n\ (x)}{d(x)} = 0 \Leftrightarrow n\ (x) = 0\  \land \ q(x) \neq 0</m></p>
<p>Therefore, to find the zeros of <m>f(x)</m>, we solve <m>3x - 5 = 0</m>, giving <m>x = \frac{5}{3}</m>. Since <m>\frac{5}{3}</m> does not make the denominator zero, it is the only zero of <m>f(x)</m>.</p>
<p>The following terms and notations are useful in our next discussion.</p>
<p>Given a number <em>a</em>,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><m>x</m> approaches <em>a</em> from the right means <em>x</em> takes any value near and near to <em>a</em> but <em>x</em> &gt; <em>a</em>. This is denoted by: <em>x</em>→<em>a</em><sup>+</sup> (read: ‘<em>x</em> approaches <em>a</em> from the right’ ).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, <em>x</em>→ 1<sup>+</sup> means <em>x</em> can be 1.001, 1.0001, 1.00001, 1.000001, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><m>x</m> approaches <em>a</em> from the left means <em>x</em> takes any value near and near to <em>a</em> but <em>x</em> &lt; <em>a</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is denoted by: <em>x</em>→<em>a</em><sup>–</sup> (read: ‘<em>x</em> approaches <em>a</em> from the left’ ).</p>
<p>For instance, <em>x</em>→1<sup>–</sup> means <em>x</em> can be 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, 0.9999, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>x</em>→∞ (read: ‘<em>x</em> approaches or tends to <em>infinity</em>’) means the value of <em>x</em> gets indefinitely larger and larger in magnitude (keep increasing without bound). For instance, <em>x</em> can be 10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>10</sup>, 10<sup>12</sup>, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><em>x</em>→ –∞ (read: ‘<em>x</em> approaches or tends to negative <em>infinity</em>’) means the value of <em>x</em> is negative and gets indefinitely larger and larger negative in magnitude (keep decreasing without bound). For instance, <em>x</em> can be –10<sup>6</sup>, –10<sup>10</sup>, –10<sup>12</sup>, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The same meanings apply also for the values of a function <em>f</em> if we wrote <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)→∞ or <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)→−∞. The following figure illustrates these notion and notations.</p>

<p>We may also write <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)→<em>b</em> (read: ‘<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) approaches <em>b</em>’) to mean the function values, <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>), becomes arbitrarily closer and closer to <em>b</em> (i.e., approximately <em>b</em>) but not exactly equal to <em>b</em>. For instance, if , then <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)→0 as <em>x</em>→∞; i.e., is approximately 0 when <em>x</em> is arbitrarily large.</p>
<p>The following steps are usually used to sketch (or draw) the graph of a rational function <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Identify the domain and simplify it.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the intercepts of the graph whenever possible. Recall the following:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>y–intercept is the point on y-axis where the graph of <em>y</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) intersects with the <em>y</em>-axis. At this point <em>x</em>=0. Thus, <em>y</em> = <em>f</em>(0), or (0, <em>f</em>(0) ) is the y-intercept if 0∈Dom(<em>f</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>x–intercept is the point on x-axis where the graph of <em>y</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) intersects with the <em>x</em>-axis. At this point <em>y</em>=0. Thus, <em>x</em>=<em>a</em> or (<em>a</em>, 0) is x-intercept if <em>f</em>(<em>a</em>)=0.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Determine the asymptotes of the graph. Here, remember the following.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Vertical Asymptote: The vertical line <em>x</em>=<em>a</em> is called a vertical asymptote(VA) of <em>f</em>(<em>x)</em> if</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p><em>a</em>∉dom(<em>f</em>), i.e., <em>f</em> is not defined at <em>x</em>=<em>a</em>; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)→∞ or <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)→ –∞ when <em>x</em>→<em>a</em><sup>+</sup> or <em>x</em>→<em>a</em><sup>–</sup> . In this case, the graph of <em>f</em> is almost vertically rising upward (if <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)→∞) or sinking downward (if <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)→−∞) along with the vertical line <em>x</em>=<em>a</em> when <em>x</em> approaches <em>a</em> either from the right or from the left.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><alert>Example 3.27</alert>: Consider where <em>a</em> ≥ 0 and <em>n</em> is a positive integer.</p>
<p>Obviously <em>a</em>∉Dom(<em>f</em>). Next, we investigate the trend of the values of <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) near <em>a</em>. To do this, we consider two cases, when <em>n</em> is even or odd:</p>
<p>Suppose <em>n</em> is even: In this case (<em>x</em> – <em>a</em>)<em><sup>n</sup></em> &gt; 0 for all <em>x</em>∈ℜ\{<em>a</em>}; and since (<em>x</em> – <em>a</em>)<em><sup>n</sup></em> →0 as <em>x</em>→<em>a</em><sup>+</sup> or <em>x</em>→<em>a</em><sup>–</sup> . Hence, as <em>x</em>→<em>a</em><sup>+</sup> or <em>x</em>→<em>a</em><sup>–</sup> . Therefore, <em>x=a</em> is a VA of <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>). Moreover, <em>y</em>= 1/<em>a<sup>n</sup></em> or (0, 1/<em>a<sup>n</sup></em> ) is its y-intercept since <em>f</em>(0)=1/<em>a<sup>n</sup></em>. However, it has no x-intercept since <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) &gt;0 for all <em>x</em> in its domain (See, Fig. 2.2 (A)).</p>
<p>Suppose <em>n</em> is odd: In this case (<em>x</em> – <em>a</em>)<em><sup>n</sup></em>&gt; 0 for all <em>x</em>&gt;<em>a</em> and 1/ (<em>x</em> – <em>a</em>)<em><sup>n</sup></em> →∞ when <em>x</em>→<em>a</em><sup>+</sup> as in the above case. Thus, <em>x=a</em> is its VA. However, 1/(<em>x</em>–<em>a</em>)<em><sup>n</sup></em>→ –∞ when <em>x</em>→<em>a</em><sup>–</sup> since (<em>x</em> – <em>a</em>)<em><sup>n</sup></em>&lt; 0 for <em>x</em>&lt;<em>a</em>. Moreover, <em>y</em>= –1/<em>a<sup>n</sup></em> or (0, –1/<em>a<sup>n</sup></em> ) is its y-intercept since <em>f</em>(0) = –1/<em>a<sup>n</sup></em>. However, it has no x-intercept also in this case. (See, Fig. 2.2 (B)).</p>
<p>Note that in both cases, as <em>x</em>→∞or <em>x</em>→ –∞.</p>

<p><alert>Remark</alert>: Let be a rational function. Then,</p>
<p>1. if and , then <em>x=a</em> is a VA of <em>f</em> .</p>
<p>2. if , then <em>x=a</em> may or may <alert>not</alert> be a VA of <em>f</em> . In this case, simplify <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) and look for VA of the simplest form of <em>f</em>.</p>
</cell>
</row>
</tabular>

<ul>
<li><p>Horizontal Asymptote: A horizontal line <em>y</em>=<em>b</em> is called horizontal asymptote (HA) of <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) if the value of the function becomes closer and closer to <em>b</em> (i.e., <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)→<em>b</em>)as <em>x</em>→∞ or as <em>x</em>→ –∞.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, the graph of <em>f</em> becomes almost a horizontal line along with (or near) the line <em>y=b</em> as <em>x</em>→∞ and as <em>x</em>→–∞. For instance, from the above example, the HA of is <em>y</em>=0 (the x-axis) , for any positive integer <em>n</em> (See, Fig. 2.2).</p>

<p><alert>Remark</alert>: A rational function has a HA only when <em>degree</em>(<em>n</em>(<em>x</em>)) ≤<em>degree</em>(<em>d</em>(<em>x</em>)).</p>
<p>In this case, (i) If <em>degree</em>(<em>n</em>(<em>x</em>)) &lt;<em>degree</em>(<em>d</em>(<em>x</em>)), then <em>y</em> = 0 (the x-axis) is the HA of <em>f</em>.</p>
<p>(ii) If <em>degree</em>(<em>n</em>(<em>x</em>)) =<em>degree</em>(<em>d</em>(<em>x</em>))<em>=n</em>, i.e., ,</p>

<p>then is the HA of <em>f</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Oblique Asymptote: The oblique line <em>y</em>=<em>ax</em>+<em>b</em>, <em>a</em>≠0, is called an oblique asymptote (OA) of <em>f</em> if the value of the function, <em>f</em>(<em>x),</em> becomes closer and closer to <em>ax</em>+<em>b</em>(i.e., <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) becomes approximately <em>ax</em>+<em>b</em>) as either <em>x</em>→∞ or <em>x</em>→ –∞. In this case, the graph of <em>f</em> becomes almost a straight line along with (or near) the oblique line <em>y</em>=<em>ax</em>+<em>b</em> as <em>x</em>→∞ and as <em>x</em>→ –∞.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><alert>Note</alert>: A rational function has an OA only when <em>degree</em>(<em>n</em>(<em>x</em>)) = <em>degree</em>(<em>d</em>(<em>x</em>)) + 1. In this case, using long division, if the quotient of <em>n</em>(<em>x</em>) ÷<em>d</em>(<em>x</em>) is <em>ax +b</em>, then <em>y</em>=<em>ax</em>+<em>b</em> is the OA of <em>f</em>.</p>
<p><alert>Example 3.28:</alert> Sketch the graphs of</p>
<p><alert>Solution</alert>: (a) Since <em>x</em>−1=0 at <em>x</em>=1, dom(<em>f</em>) = ℜ\{1}.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Intercepts: y-intercept: <em>x</em>=0 ⇒<em>y=f</em> (0) = –2. Hence, (0, – 2) is y-intercept.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>x-intercept: <em>y</em>=0 ⇒<em>x</em>+2=0 ⇒<em>x</em>= –2. Hence, (–2, 0) is x-intercept.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Asymptotes:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>VA: Since <em>x</em>−1=0 at<em>x</em>=1 and <em>x</em>+2≠0 at <em>x</em>=1, <em>x</em>=1 is VA of <em>f</em>. In fact, if <em>x</em>→1<sup>+</sup> , then <em>x</em>+2 ≈3 but the denominator <em>x</em>–1 is almost 0 (but positive).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)→∞ as <em>x</em>→1<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)→ –∞ as <em>x</em>→1<sup>–</sup> (since , if <em>x</em>→1<sup>–</sup> then <em>x</em>–1 is almost 0 but negative ) .</p>

<p>(So, the graph of <em>f</em> rises up to +∞ at the right side of <em>x=</em>1, and sink down to −∞ at the left side of <em>x=</em>1)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>HA: Note that if you divide <em>x</em>+2 by <em>x</em>–1, the quotient is 1 and remainder is 3. Thus,</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>. Thus, if <em>x</em>→∞ (or <em>x</em>→ –∞), then →0 so that <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)→1. Hence, <em>y</em>=1 is the HA of <em>f</em>.</p>

<p>Using these information, you can sketch the graph of <em>f</em> as displayed below in Fig. 2.3 (A).</p>
<p>(b) Both the denominator and numerator are 0 at <em>x</em>=1. So, first factorize and simplify them:</p>
<p><em>x</em><sup>2</sup>+3<em>x</em>+2=(<em>x</em>+2)(<em>x</em>+1) and <em>x</em><sup>2</sup>–1 = (<em>x –</em>1)( <em>x+</em>1) . Therefore,</p>
<p>, <em>x</em>≠ –1</p>
<p>. (So, dom(<em>g</em>) = ℜ\{1, –1} )</p>
<p>This implies that only <em>x</em>=1 is VA.</p>
<p>Hence, the graph of is exactly the same as that of except that <em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) is not defined at <em>x</em>= –1. Therefore, the graph of <em>g</em> and its VA are the same as that of <em>f</em> except that there should be a ‘hole’ at the point corresponding to <em>x</em>= –1 on the graph of <em>g</em> as shown on Fig. 2.3(B) below.</p>
