    <title>Description of Sets</title>
    <p>
        Sets are described or characterized by one of the following four different ways.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{1. Verbal Method}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this method, an ordinary English statement with minimum mathematical symbolization of 
        the property of the elements is used to describe a set. actually, the statement could be in any language.
    </p>
    <example>
    <statement>
        <p>
            <ol marker="a.">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The set of counting numbers less than ten.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The set of letters in the word <q>Addis Ababa.</q>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The set of all countries in Africa.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
        <m>\textbf{2. Roster/Complete Listing Method}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        If the elements of a set can be listed, we list them all between a pair of braces 
        without repetion separating by commas, and without concern about the order of their appearance.
        Such a method of describing a set is called <term>the rooster/complete listing</term> method.
    </p>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                <ol marker="a.">
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The set of vowels in English alphabet may also be desribed as <m>\left\{a, e, i, o, u\right\}.</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The set of positive factors of <m>24</m> is also described as <m>\left\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\right\}.</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Remark:}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol marker="i.">
            <li>
                <p>
                   We agree on the convention that the order of writing the elements in the list is immaterial.
                   As a result the sets <m>\left\{ a, b, \left\{ c\right\}\right\},\, \left\{ b, c, a\right\} \text{ and } \left\{ c, a, b\right\}</m> contain the same elements, 
                   namely <m>a, b \text{ and } c.</m>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The set <m>\left\{a, a, b, b\right\}</m> contains just two distinct elements; namely <m>a \text{ and } b,</m> hence 
                    it is the same set as <m>\left\{a, b\right\}.</m> We list distinct elements without repetition.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                <ol marker="a.">
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Let <m>A = \left\{a, b,\left\{c\right\}\right\}.</m> Elements of <m>A</m> are <m>a, b \text{ and } {c}.</m>
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                           Notice that <m>c \text{ and } \left\{c\right\}</m> are different objects. Here <m>\left\{c\right\} \in A</m> but <m>c \notin A.</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Let <m>B = \left\{\left\{a\right\}\right\}.</m> The only element of <m>B</m> is <m>\left\{a\right\}.</m> But <m>a \notin B.</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                           Let <m>C = \left\{a, b, \left\{a, b\right\}, \left\{a, \left\{a\right\}\right\}\right\}.</m> Then <m>C</m> has four elements.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                The readers are invited to write down all the elements of <m>C.</m>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{3. Partial Listing Method}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        In many occassions, the number of elements of a set may be too large to list them all; and in 
        other occassions there may not be an end to the list. In such cases we look for a common 
        property of the elements and describe the set by partially listing the elements. More precisely, 
        if the common property is simple that it can easily be identified from a list of the first few 
        elements, then within a pair of braces, we list these few elements followed (or preceded) by 
        exactly three dotes and possibly by one last element. The following are such instances of 
        describing sets by partial listing method.
    </p>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                <ol marker="a.">
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The set of all counting numbers in <m>\mathbb{N} = \left\{1, 2, 3, 4, ...\right\}.</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The set of non-positive integers is <m>\left\{..., -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, ...\right\}.</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The set of multiples of <m>5</m> is <m>\left\{..., -15, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, ...\right\}.</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The set of odd integers less than <m>100</m> is <m>\left\{..., -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, ... 99\right\}.</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Set-builder Method}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        When all the elements satisfy a common property <m>P,</m> we express the situation as an open 
        proposition <m>P(x)</m> and describe the set using a method called the <term>set-builder Method</term> 
        as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>A = \left\{x | P(x)\right\} or A = \left\{x: P(x)\right\}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        We read it as <q><m>A</m> is equal to the set of all <m>x</m>'s is true.</q> Here the bar <q>| </q> and the 
        colon <q>:</q> mean <q>such that.</q> Notice that the letter <m>x</m> is only a place holder and can be replaced 
        throughout by other letters. So, for a property <m>P,</m> the set <m>\left\{x | P(x)\right\},\, \left\{t | P(t)\right\} \text{ and } \left\{y | P(y)\right\}</m> are 
        all the same set.
    </p>
    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The following sets are described using the set-builder method.

        <m>\textbf{Remark: }</m> Some authors do not use the symbol <m>\subseteq.</m> Instead they use the symbol <m>\subset</m> for both subset 
        and proper subset. In this material, we prefer to use the notations commonly used in highschool mathematics, and 
        we continue using <m>\subseteq</m> and <m>\subset</m> differently, namely for subset and proper subset, respectively.
