    <title>Propositional Logic</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
        Mathematical or symbolic logic is an analytical theory of the art of reasoning whose goal is to systematize and codify principles of valid reasoning. 
        It has emerged from a study of the use of language in argument and persuasion and is based on the identification and examination of those parts of language which are essential for these purposes. 
        It is formal in the sense that it lacks reference to meaning. Thereby it achieves versatility: 
        it may be used to judge the correctness of a chain of reasoning (in particular, a "mathematical proof") solely on the basis of the form (and not the content) of the sequence of statements which make up the chain. 
        There is a variety of symbolic logics. We shall be concerned only with that one which encompasses most of the deductions of the sort encountered in mathematics. Within the context of logic itself, this is "classical" symbolic logic.
