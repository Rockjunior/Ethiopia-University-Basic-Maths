  <title>Representation of a Vector</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this sub unit, we consider the vector represented by a directed line segment on a
      plane. This is called a vector on a plane.

      <p>
        A vector can be represented by either algebraically or geometrically. A vector is
        represented geometrically by a <m>{\color{red} \text{directed line segment}}</m>
        segment (a line segment with direction).
        <me> </me>
        In <xref ref="representation-of-vect"/> the vector is represented by a
        directed line segment and we denote this by an
        arrow as <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m> . In this case, the point <m>A</m> is called
        the <m>{\color{red} \textit{initial}}</m> and the point <m>B</m> is called the <m>{\color{red} \textit{terminal}}</m>.

            \draw[very thick,black] (0,0) -- (6,4) node[above] {\textbf{B}};
            
            % Label points
            \node[left] at (0,0) {\textbf{A}};
            \node [red,below] at (0,-0.2){Initial Point};
            \node [red,above] at (6,4.5){Terminal Point};

            \node [above] at (3,2.1) {\textbf{a}};
            
            % Draw vector
            \draw [black,-{Latex[scale=2.5]}] (5,3.35) -- (6,4);
          \end{tikzpicture}

    <p>
      A vector also represented by using letters with an arrow bar over it such as  <m>\overrightarrow{a}</m>, <m>\overrightarrow{u}</m>, <m>\overrightarrow{v}</m>
      or
      can also be
      a bold small letters like <m>\mathbf{a}</m>, <m>\mathbf{u}</m>, <m>\mathbf{v}</m> etc. Hence, the above vector <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m>
      represented by <m>\overrightarrow{u}</m>.
